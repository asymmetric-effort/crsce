# GPU Abstraction Layer: Safety Principles

## Overview

This document defines the safety guarantees and behavioral principles for the GPU Abstraction Layer used in the CRSCE project. Unlike traditional GPU APIs such as CUDA, ROCm/HIP, or Metal, this abstraction is built to model **deterministic**, **fault-tolerant**, and **observable** behaviorâ€”both in simulation (via the emulator) and eventual hardware implementation.

## Safety Principles

### 1. **Deterministic Failure on Invalid Memory Access**

- Access to deallocated memory (e.g., after `reset()`) is explicitly **detected** and **rejected**.
- The GPU emulator will not dereference invalid pointers.
- An error status is returned to the host for all invalid `readBuffer()`, `writeBuffer()`, or `launchKernel()` operations.

### 2. **Pointer Provenance Tracking**

- All device-side allocations are registered in an internal structure.
- Validity is checked before any read/write/kernel operation.
- This ensures that only legitimate pointers are ever used.

### 3. **Graceful Deallocation**

- Calls to `freeBuffer()` on already-freed or unknown pointers are **idempotent**.
- Such operations log a diagnostic message but never crash or corrupt internal state.

### 4. **Reset Behavior**

- `reset()` deallocates all buffers without terminating the emulator.
- All future operations referencing old pointers will be rejected.
- The emulator remains reusable after reset.

### 5. **Shutdown Behavior**

- `shutdown()` releases all resources and exits the emulator cleanly.
- Parent processes use `shutdown()` to synchronize teardown.
- Redundant shutdowns are safe and ignored.

### 6. **Consistency Across Platforms**

- These principles apply to the emulator **and to future hardware realizations**.
- No undefined behavior is permitted at any point in the abstraction.

## Design Goals

| Feature                        | Traditional GPUs     | CRSCE Abstraction     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Undefined memory access       | Possible             | Never                  |
| Pointer validation            | Not enforced         | Always enforced        |
| Post-reset buffer usage       | Crashes or invalid   | Rejected cleanly       |
| Kernel crash behavior         | May crash silently   | Logged and recoverable |
| Freeing invalid pointer       | May crash or leak    | Idempotent             |

## Conclusion

This abstraction is engineered for **robustness**, **testability**, and **predictability**. These safety guarantees allow developers to prototype and deploy high-assurance algorithms with confidence in both emulator and hardware environments.
