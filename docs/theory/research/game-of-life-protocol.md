## Summary

Game of Life Protocol models the CRSCE decompression problem as a parallel cellular automaton (CA) system, where
each bit in the CSM is treated as a cell governed by discrete update rules. At each iteration, every cell evaluates
its local neighborhood—specifically its participation in row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal sums—and adjusts
its state (0 or 1) based on majority rules, local constraint satisfaction, or residual minimization. Updates are
performed synchronously across the entire grid using GPU threads. Over successive rounds, the field self-organizes
toward a globally consistent state. Convergence is typically fast due to the regularity and tight coupling of CRSCE’s
constraints, and the approach is especially effective when initialized with prior marginal probabilities (e.g., from
belief propagation). While not guaranteed to converge uniquely, the Game of Life Protocol often brings the solution
close enough for final hash-polishing or local repair.
