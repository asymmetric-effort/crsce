Decompression Options
=====================

<p>
<a href="deterministic-elimination.md">"Deterministic Elimination"</a> is a pretty obvious first step in the process. 
But Radditz Sieve and local search are inefficient, expensive (time and energy). We need better options.

Below is a table of options:

    <tr>
      <td><a href="Radditz-Sieve.md">Radditz Sieve</a></td>
      <td>
        Deterministic elimination, massively parallel sieve on GPU, CPU-thread sift, and GPU SHA-256 verification 
        in one combined pipeline.  This is the original algorithm.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="./LoopyBp.md">Loopy Belief Propagation</a></td>
      <td>
        Loopy BP on the factor graph of row/column/diagonal/anti-diagonal constraints, with messages updated in 
        parallel on the GPU. Applying loopy belief propagation to CRSCE had mixed but interesting results.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="game-of-life-protocol.md">Game-of-Life Protocol</a></td>
      <td>Majority-vote cellular automaton where each cell flips or holds based on its four sum-residuals, iterating 
          until convergence. With GPU parallelism, GOLP was a weekend experiment that performed poorly at first. But
          it inspired some new thinking.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="game-of-beliefs-protocol.md">Game of Beliefs Protocol</a></td>
      <td>
        The row-centric nature of Radditz Sieve, the probabilistic nature of Loopy Beliefs (pun intended) and the
        concurrent realism of GOLP were combined into a single hybrid protocol called Game of Beliefs Protocol (GOBP).
        This protocol uses a hierarchical row-based thread model to solve each row independently while sharing 
        knowledge among the rows from a single row-master thread.  This row-master then controls the solution of its 
        row asynchronously.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="Path-Integral-QMC-on-GPU.md">Path-Integral QMC on GPU</a></td>
      <td>
        Suzukiâ€“Trotter mapping of a transverse-field Ising QUBO, sampled via path-integral Monte Carlo 
        kernels on the GPU. This is a future opportunity to extend CRSCE into a quantum computing model.
